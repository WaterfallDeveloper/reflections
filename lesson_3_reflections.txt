Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Clones are independent copies of a local remote git repository. Forks are clones of existing remote repositories. Commits to forks can be traced back to the original repository. Branches are different tracks on a repository which implement significant changes to a program
