Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	the remote repository may have received additions from other users or computers so the repository would be out of sync with my local copy
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Clones are independent copies of a local remote git repository. Forks are clones of existing remote repositories. Commits to forks can be traced back to the original repository. Branches are different tracks on a repository which implement significant changes to a program 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	so you know about the development and changes added to the project. This helps you decide if when and where you would merge the remote with the local version.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	it would be definitely harder, if not impossible, to keep track of the different stages and versions of a project, especially when it comes to merging. The admin effort to maintain the git repository is tremendous though and would be much less if working with manual copies of a project
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	I consider the master being a version of my prject in production. Therefore I would only touch it, if I have a tested new working version ready which I would then merge with the master.
