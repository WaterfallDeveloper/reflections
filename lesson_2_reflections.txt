What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a new repository is created and all files in the repository are known but
	not tracked or committed as long they are not added to a commit
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	it is where you define which files to use for a commit. It always includes
	the files from the last commit. A working directory can have additional
	modified files which are not in the staging area yet.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can check the difference of the change compared to the last commit before commiting the changes in the staging area
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	when I want to experiment with some new features or create a localized or different version but don't want to touch the master/production versionan
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	they help me understand to see commits which are potentially unreachable
	I better understand when to create a new branch if I don't want to loose track of the changes done after a pre-master commit
