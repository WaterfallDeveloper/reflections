What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a new repository is created and all files in the repository are known but
	not tracked or committed as long they are not added to a commit
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	it is where you define which files to use for a commit. It always includes
	the files from the last commit. A working directory can have additional
	modified files which are not in the staging area yet.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can check the difference of the change compared to the last commit before commiting the changes in the staging area
